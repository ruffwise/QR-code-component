## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I did this project just after doing the Product-preview-card, so, this challenged basically helped me fine tune my css skills on flexbox.


### Continued development

Next plan is to do more challenges to fine-tune my basic CSS skills
